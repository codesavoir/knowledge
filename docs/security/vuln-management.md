# Vulnerability Management

Systematic detection, triage & remediation.

## Sources
- SCA (dependencies)
- Container scanning
- Infrastructure scanning
- Runtime detection (eBPF, IDS)

## Process
1. Ingest findings
2. De-duplicate & prioritize (CVSS + exploitability + context)
3. Remediation tracking
4. Metrics & reporting (MTTR, backlog burn)
