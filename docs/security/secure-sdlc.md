# Secure SDLC

Integrate security across the software lifecycle.

## Phases
- Requirements (threat modeling)
- Design (architectural risk analysis)
- Implementation (SAST, secrets scanning)
- Build (dependency scanning, SBOM)
- Test (DAST, fuzzing)
- Release (signing, provenance)
- Operate (runtime monitoring, patching)

## Shift Left Practices
- Security champions
- Pre-commit hooks
- Policy as code
