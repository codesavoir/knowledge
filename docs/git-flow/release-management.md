# Release Management

Plan and deliver stable versions.

## Process (Git Flow Style)
1. Create `release/x.y.z` from develop
2. Final testing & small fixes
3. Update version, docs, changelog
4. Merge into main + tag
5. Merge back into develop

## Tags
Lightweight markers of versions.

## Hotfix
Bug in production? Branch from main, fix, tag, merge to develop.
