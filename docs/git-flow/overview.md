# Git Flow: Introduction

Git Flow is a structured way to manage code changes using branches.

## Why It Helps
- Organizes work
- Supports teamwork
- Safer releases

## Core Idea
Separate long-lived branches (main, develop) from short-lived feature/fix branches.

## Diagram Idea
(main) <--- (develop) <--- feature branches
