# SRE Principles

Site Reliability Engineering blends software engineering & operations.

## Core Tenets
- Embrace risk (error budgets).
- Eliminate toil (automate repetitive work).
- Measure everything (SLIs/SLOs).
- Engineer for reliability (capacity, redundancy, graceful degradation).

## Practice Areas
- Reliability & availability
- Incident response
- Capacity planning
- Change management
- Monitoring & observability

## Culture
Blameless postmortems & learning loops.
