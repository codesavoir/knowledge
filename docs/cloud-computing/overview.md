# Cloud Computing: Introduction

Cloud computing means using the internet to access shared computer resources (like servers, storage, databases) instead of owning physical hardware.

## Why It Matters
- Reduces upfront cost (no buying big servers)
- Easy to scale up or down
- Pay only for what you use
- Global access (data centers around the world)

## Simple Analogy
Like renting electricity instead of running your own power plant.

## Visual Idea
(Imagine a diagram with: User -> Internet -> Cloud Provider (Compute, Storage, Network))

## Learning Goals
- Understand basic terms
- Know service & deployment models
- Recognize practical examples
