# Compute, Storage & Networking Basics

## Compute
Runs code. VM instances, containers, serverless functions.

## Storage Types
- Object Storage (store files as objects) – scalable, cheap.
- Block Storage (virtual disks) – attached to VMs.
- File Storage (shared file system) – for shared access.

## Networking
- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): your isolated network.
- Subnet: smaller network segment.
- Security Group / Firewall: controls traffic.

## Example Flow
User -> Load Balancer -> App Server -> Database -> Object Storage
